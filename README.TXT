In the immortal words of Obi Wan Kenobi,

>  This is not the branch you are looking for.

This repository has branches that map to the various releases of the
WiX toolset. For example, the `wix40` branch contains the code that
makes up the WiX Toolset v4.0. A branch no longer accepts changes
once the stable release is published to http://wixtoolset.org/releases/
so be sure to enlist in an active branch.

If you are unsure which branches are active, contact the wix-devs
mailing list, see: http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/mailinglist/
