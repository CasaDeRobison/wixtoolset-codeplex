http://wixtoolset.org/releases/ provides links to archived stable
versions of the WiX Toolset. Unfortunately, the links to versions
prior to v3.11 simply take you to a page where you can download
an archive of releases (among other things) from CodePlex. They
are not easy to access due to the structure of the files within
the zip archive.

Those files have been extracted and committed to this repository
in the hope that they might prove useful to others who have a
need for an older release of WiX Toolset that isn't currently
easily accessible.
